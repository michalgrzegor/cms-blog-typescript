## General info

This code is a refactored application from [this repository](https://github.com/michalgrzegor/cms-blog)

This frontend application works together with this
[rails application](https://github.com/matigrzegor/cms-blog)

This is a blog website and blog content management application. You can create, edit, and delete
posts. In the administration panel, you can generate tokens needed to register new authors. The
application allows you to manage your profile.

## Tech info

- The CMS blog was written in **Typescript**. I used **Webpack** and split the code into
  modules.
- Authentication and authorization have been implemented based on the **OAuth 2.0** protocol using
  the **Authorization Code Grant** flow.
- An **access token** is stored in a variable and when refreshing the page or when the access token
  expires, **refresh token** allows an application to obtain a new access token.
- For communication between authentication objects, I used the mediator pattern.
- I used the WYSIWYG **Quill** editor and **Delta** format for API communication.
- The drop-down menu is written in **Web Component** technology.
- I used **Jest** for testing applications.
- In a project, I wanted to learn asynchronous JavaScript and write reusable components.
